\title{Moleculors full vertex Laplacian matrix}
\usage{
Laplacian_Vdistance_full()
}
\value{
Laplacian vertex full matrix for the loaded molecule. Matrix is stored in Mol_mat environment.
}
\description{
This function return the laplacian matrix for the vertex distance matrix
it take as input the Vadj_full_matrix and for each element return
-1 if elemij = 1, sum'elemi, == 1' if i = j 'which is the angle of the vertex'
and 0 for every other element
