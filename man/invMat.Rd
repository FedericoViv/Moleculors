\title{Moleculors inverse matrix}
\usage{
invMat(A)
}
\value{
Inverse matrix of the input matrix A
}
\description{
Compute the inverse matrix of the input A using the determinant and the adj matrix
this function is not computing efficient due to the computation of the determinant
is supposed to be used for small matrices
}
\examples{
A = matrix(1,2,3,5)
invMat(A)

}
